Implementattion of gamification features such as achievements, leaderboards, and events to allow the user to gain point and level up.
**This is just an idea of add-on for the app not a PR.** 
The feature is implemented using the google play games service to have a preview for the suggestion. I think that a real world implementation in the Immuni app can not make use of an external service (for privacy?)(moreover to not exclude users with phones that doesn't support google services).

I apologize if someone will feel offended or insultated by the application of game principles in a serious non-game context. My main focus was to try to reinforce the appeal of the app and try to increase the user retention for the social cause.
